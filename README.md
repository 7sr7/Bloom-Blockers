# Information
Project Repository for 2025 Spring INTRO ENGINEERING DESIGN-PILOT - ENGR 2050 - 10, supervised by Professor Lander and Professor Vener.
Team 4, Bloom Blockers.

# 📌 Project Overview
Bloom Blockers is a low-cost, automated water quality monitoring solution aimed at addressing nutrient pollution caused by fertilizer runoff. Excessive nitrate and phosphate levels in water bodies lead to harmful algal blooms, which negatively impact ecosystems, water quality, and agriculture. Current monitoring solutions are expensive, labor-intensive, and inaccessible to everyday users.

Our goal is to design a cost-effective, easy-to-use, and durable water quality monitoring system that enables real-time, remote data collection.

# 🏆 Our Solution
We are developing a low-cost, real-time nutrient sensor that provides continuous monitoring of water quality. The device is:

- Affordable – Designed to cost under $100, making it accessible for farmers, researchers, and educators.
- Automated – Capable of collecting and transmitting water quality data remotely, reducing manual labor.
- Accurate – Provides reliable nitrate and phosphate measurements within 5% error.
- User-friendly – Simple setup and minimal maintenance, suitable for non-experts.
- Durable – Designed to last at least a year in outdoor water environments.
- Sustainable – Uses low-power components and environmentally friendly materials.

# 🌍 Why This Matters
- 🌱 Prevents Algal Blooms – Helps mitigate nutrient runoff, protecting aquatic life.
- 💰 Saves Farmers Money – Optimizes fertilizer use, reducing waste and costs.
- 🚜 Supports Agriculture – Enables more efficient water resource management.
- 🏛 Aids Researchers & Government Agencies – Provides consistent and scalable water quality data.

# 🔬 Technology Stack
- Hardware: Raspberry Pi-based sensor system
- Sensors: Nitrate and phosphate detection modules
- Connectivity: Remote data transmission via WiFi or LoRa
- Software: Python-based data processing with cloud integration for remote monitoring
- Power: Low-energy design for extended outdoor use

# 👥 Target Users
- 🌾 Farmers – Manage irrigation efficiency and reduce fertilizer waste.
- 🏫 Educators – Teach water quality monitoring with an affordable tool.
- 🌊 Environmental Groups – Monitor water bodies for conservation efforts.
- 🏢 Government Agencies – Track nutrient pollution and enforce regulations.

# 🚀 Future Plans
- Develop an open-source dashboard for real-time monitoring.
- Enhance sensor calibration and precision for improved accuracy.
- Expand sensor capabilities to detect additional pollutants.
- Deploy in pilot programs with farmers and conservation groups.
